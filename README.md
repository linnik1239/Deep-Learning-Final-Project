# Deep-Learning-Final-Project


The aim of this project is to performÂ the segmentation of cell nuclei in microscopy images. 
This project includes designing and training a DNN that performs pixel-wise segmentation into three classes i.e, background, cell nucleus, and cell contour.


The explanations you can find on CellSegmentationReport.pdf file.
